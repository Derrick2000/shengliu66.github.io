# About Me
* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). [[Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rzhzR-cAAAAJ&hl=en)]
* My research interests lie in general area of machine learning, particularly in robust deep learning with imperfect datasets (corrupted data, limited supervision, small data, etc.) as its applications on deep learning for healthcare such as Alzheimer's automatic detection. I am a member of the Math and Data (MAD) group at NYU where I work on inverse problems and optimization.
