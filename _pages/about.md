# About Me
* I am a Ph.D. student at the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). [[Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rzhzR-cAAAAJ&hl=en)]
* My research interests lie in general area of machine learning, particularly in robust deep learning with imperfect datasets (corrupted data, limited supervision, small data, etc.) I am also interested in deep learning for healthcare such as Alzheimer's automatic detection. I am also a member of the Math and Data (MAD) group at NYU where I work on inverse problems and optimization.
